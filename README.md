I successfully implemented a range of functionalities for a website project, ensuring it was fully responsive and adhered strictly to the Figma design provided:

1. **Full Responsiveness:** Ensured that the entire website was fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop views, while maintaining a consistent and user-friendly layout.
2. **Adherence to Figma Design:** All the designs and layouts followed the Figma design provided, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy in the user interface and experience.
3. **Carousel Functionality:** Integrated a fully functional carousel that allows users to scroll through users testimonials, enhancing the user experience.
4. **Navbar Enhancements:** Developed a responsive navbar that transforms into a sidebar when viewed on smaller screens. The hamburger icon triggers this sidebar, which slides in from the left. Additionally, when the sidebar is open, the rest of the page is blurred for a seamless user interaction.
5. **User Management:**
   Added a user section in the navbar, where users can be created, updated, and managed.
   Built a user registration form that captures the following information:
   First Name
   Last Name
   Email
   Password
   Profile Picture (uploaded by the user)
   Auto-incremented User ID (system-assigned)
   Implemented file writing functionality to store user information, which automatically updates a user table whenever a new user is saved.
   Created Update and Delete buttons next to each user in the table. When updating, the form reopens with pre-filled data for easy editing.
   Profile pictures are displayed in the user table, and when hovered over, the image enlarges for better visibility.
6. **Table Functionality:**
   Designed a table with pagination to handle a large number of users efficiently.
   Integrated filters to allow users to search across all properties via a search bar.
   Sorting capabilities were added for ID and Created At columns, allowing both ascending and descending order sorting.
   The table automatically logs the Created At and Updated At timestamps for each user.
7. **Quiz Functionality:** Developed a quiz feature where users can select an answer, and feedback is immediately provided. If the selected answer is correct, it turns green, and if incorrect, it turns red.
